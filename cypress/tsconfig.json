// Cypress globally defines Mocha-based expect/it etc that conflict with jest.
// To resolve, the top level tsconfig.json needs to exclude cypress files,
// and this secondary tsconfig.json needs to point to the cypress files and
// give them the right cypress types.
// Also, removing the default import definition in commands.ts seemed to help.
